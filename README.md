# PortfolioApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

## Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

# Run the backend:

go to teminal
cd to your project/backend
node server.js

Run your Angular frontend:

go to teminal
cd to your project/frontend
ng serve
